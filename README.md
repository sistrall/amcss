[AMCSS](http://amcss.github.io/) in Ruby.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sistrall/amcss.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sistrall/amcss)

## Why AMCSS?

Nowadays it seems like "to do everything using classes" is the mantra for most CSS development.
Why can't we use different approaches? AMCSS uses custom, namespaced attributes and mostly unknown
CSS selector to apply style to the page.

Take a deep breath and [have a look at the documentation](http://amcss.github.io/), 'cause it worths
a moment of you developer time.

## Install

```ruby
gem 'amcss'
```

And then execute:

```bash

```

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage
